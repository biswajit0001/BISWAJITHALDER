    <h2> BLACK HOLE </h2>
    <p>
        A black hole is a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. This phenomenon is a consequence of the gravitational collapse of a massive star. <br><br><br>

Black holes are characterized by their event horizon, which is an imaginary boundary beyond which nothing can return. The size of the event horizon is determined by the mass of the black hole. Once an object crosses this boundary, it is essentially lost to the black hole, and no information about it can be retrieved.<br><br><br>

Despite their name, black holes are not holes in the conventional sense, but rather incredibly dense concentrations of mass. The core of a black hole, known as the singularity, is thought to be infinitely dense and surrounded by a region of extreme gravitational distortion.<br><br><br>

There are different types of black holes, including stellar black holes formed from the remnants of massive stars, and supermassive black holes that are millions or even billions of times more massive than our sun, found at the centers of galaxies. <br><br><br>

Black holes have been a subject of intense scientific study and have provided insights into our understanding of general relativity and the nature of spacetime. They are also a source of fascination in popular science and science fiction due to their mysterious and extreme properties.<br><br><br>

In recent years, advances in observational astronomy, particularly through technologies like the Event Horizon Telescope, have enabled scientists to capture images of the immediate environment around a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, providing direct evidence of their existence.<br><br><br>

While black holes are still objects of ongoing research and investigation, they continue to be a source of wonder and intrigue for scientists and the general public alike.<br><br><br>
