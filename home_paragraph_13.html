    <h2> SCHOOL </h2>
    <p>
A school is an educational institution where students receive structured instruction and learning experiences. Schools play a vital role in society by providing formal education to children and young adults, typically ranging from early childhood through adolescence. They are crucial in imparting knowledge, fostering social development, and preparing individuals for future responsibilities.
<br><br><br>
Schools can vary widely in terms of their level of education, ranging from preschools and kindergartens for young children, to primary schools (elementary schools) that cover the early years of formal education, to secondary schools (high schools) that provide education for adolescents.
<br><br>
Here are some key aspects of schools:
<br><br>
1. <t>Curriculum:</t> Schools follow a curriculum, which is a set of planned courses and educational activities designed to achieve specific learning objectives. Curricula can include subjects like mathematics, science, language arts, social studies, and more.
<br><br><br>
2. <t>Teachers:</t> Schools employ qualified educators who are responsible for delivering lessons, guiding students, and assessing their progress. Teachers play a crucial role in the learning process.
<br><br><br>
3. <t>Facilities:</t> Schools have physical facilities such as classrooms, libraries, laboratories, sports fields, and other spaces designed to support learning and extracurricular activities.
<br><br><br>
4. <t>Education Levels:</t> Schools can be categorized based on the age groups they cater to, including preschools, primary schools, middle schools, high schools, and sometimes colleges or universities.
<br><br><br>
5. <t>Public vs. Private:</t> Schools can be publicly funded and run by government authorities, or they can be private institutions operated by independent organizations or individuals. Private schools often have different fee structures and may offer specialized curricula.
<br><br><br>
6. <t>Extracurricular Activities:</t> Many schools offer extracurricular programs such as sports, clubs, arts, and community service activities to complement academic learning and promote a well-rounded education.<br><br><br>

7. <t>Assessment and Evaluation:</t> Schools use various methods to assess students' progress, which can include tests, exams, projects, and other forms of evaluation.
<br><br><br>
8. <t>Social Development:</t> Schools provide opportunities for students to interact with peers, develop social skills, and learn important values such as teamwork, respect, and responsibility.<br><br><br>

9. <t>Parental Involvement:</t> In many cases, schools encourage and facilitate parental involvement in their child's education through parent-teacher meetings, volunteer opportunities, and other forms of engagement.<br><br><br>

Education is considered a fundamental human right, and schools are critical institutions in ensuring that this right is accessible to all. They serve as the cornerstone of a society's educational system, contributing to the overall development and progress of communities and nations.<br><br><br>
